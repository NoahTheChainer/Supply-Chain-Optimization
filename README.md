This manufacturer only produces wine and beer glasses:

- There is a maximum production capacity of 60 hours
- Each batch of wine and beer glasses takes 6 and 5 hours respectively
- The warehouse has a maximum capacity of 150 rack spaces
- Each batch of the wine and beer glasses takes 10 and 20 spaces respectively
- The production equipment can only make full batches, no partial batches

Also, we only have orders for 6 batches of wine glasses. Therefore, we do not want to produce more than this. Each batch of the wine glasses earns a profit of $5 and the beer $4.5.

The objective is to maximize the profit for the manufacturer.
